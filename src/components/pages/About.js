        Hi!

        I grew up in a small town called Crosby, Texas to the east of Houston. I attended
        Crosby High School and briefly attended the University of Texas at Dallas. I graduated from
        the Coding Bootcamp of UTA in 2022 and earned my certificate there. I like to workout,
        draw and be creative and have an extensive history in game making.
